- Linear -> Logistic -> Neural Networks 

---Topic4.LIME---
+ Summary Step : 
- Load the data 
- Check if any NaN value/ duplicate data 
- Label Encoding ( from String to Number ) + export to the csv file + update the value to "data" varuable
- Remove the column want to validate the logistic  regression ( attrition as example) 
- Create a training dataset + test dataset (use train_test_split from the library) 
- Logistic regression : Train data for getting the result -> use test for collecting the accuracy 
- Random Forest : Train data for getting the result -> use test for collecting the accuracy 
- Evaluate : find the important attribute impact to the result 
- LIME explainer , evaluate how the attribute impact the result 
- Linear regresstion 
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Correlation matrix
