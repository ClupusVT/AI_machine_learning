1. Interact with the dataset download form kaggle
   + Labeling : labeling_dataset.py
   + Create test/vaidatate dataset that support for yolov8 :create_val_test.py
   + Check if dataset had duplicated image : check_duplicate.py
   + Change class on the label folder for approprate action : changing_label_class.py
   + Dowwnload the model immediately after trainning to avoid corruption : GG_colab_download_model.py
   + Interact data from roboflow to google class -> use some kind of method to perform tranning : Get_better_model_tf_minst_roboflow_complete.ipynb
   + Build the mass validate set with data capture from roboflow : Select_images_depend_on_class.py
2. Verify The result after tranning model :
   + validating_model.py
